#' join_drugdata
#'
#' Function to join a list of data.frames. It is the same as the join_all function
#' from the plyr package but allow to use the full_join function from the dplyr package
#' and so to add suffixes to duplicated names not selecting by the argument by.
#'
#' @param dfs A list of data frames
#' @param by A character vector of variables to join by.
#'           If NULL, the default, full_join() will perform a natural join, using all variables in common across the data frames.
#'           A message lists the variables so that you can check they're correct; suppress the message by supplying
#'           by explicitly.
#'
#'           To join by different variables, use a named vector. For example, by = c("a" = "b") will match x$a to y$b.
#'           To join by multiple variables, use a vector with length > 1. For example, by = c("a", "b") will match
#'           x$a to y$a and x$b to y$b. Use a named vector to match different variables in x and y.
#'           For example, by = c("a" = "b", "c" = "d") will match x$a to y$b and x$c to y$d.
#'           x being the data frame named 'joined' and y the data frame i from dfs.
#'
#'
#' @return The joined dataframe
