\arguments{
\item{hits}{A data.frame containing the genes id, a score value and preferably a treatment column but not necessary.}

\item{gene_column}{The name of the column that contains the genes. Default is 'Gene'.}

\item{score_column}{The name of the column that contains the score values. Default is 'IS'.}

\item{treatment_column}{The name of the column that contains the treatments. Default is NULL.}

\item{treatment}{The name of the treatment you want to keep. Default is NULL.}

\item{species}{Specify the species. Currently, only 'human' and 'mouse' are available.}

\item{pos_enrichment}{Logical to tell if you want to only look at positive enrichment score.
If FALSE, show only negative.}

\item{pval_cutoff}{The p-value cutoff for the enrichment analysis.}

\item{minGSSize}{minimal size of each gene set for analyzing. default here is 3}

\item{database}{Specify the database. Currently, WikiPathway, KEGG, GO and CETSA are available.}
}
\value{
