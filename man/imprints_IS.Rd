\arguments{
\item{data}{The input data set from which categorization is performed on and hitlist is produced from.}

\item{data_diff}{The output from imprints_caldiff; can be NULL and if so will compute it; can also be a path to the data.}

\item{ctrl}{The name of the control.}

\item{valid_val}{The percentage of valid values you want per treatment. If less, score will be set to NA,
i.e. the protein will not be a hit}

\item{IS_cutoff}{The I-score cutoff. Default is 1.5.}

\item{fixed_score_cutoff}{Logical to tell if you want to use a fixed cutoff for the I-score.
If TRUE, the value IS_cutoff will directly be used as the cutoff and for all treatments. If FALSE,
the I-score cutoff will be calculated as the value selected for IS_cutoff plus the median of the
I-scores of the proteins which have a p-value lower than the median of all p-values for a given treatment.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{FDR}{The FDR used for the BH corrected combined p-value}

\item{curvature}{The curvature used for the curve on the volcano plot}

\item{FDR_category}{The FDR used for the BH corrected  p-value at 37Â°C used in order to categorize the hits}

\item{folder_name}{The name of the folder in which you want to save the results.}

\item{peptide_count_col}{The name of the column that contain the unique peptide count.
If it is sumUniPeps, don't bother with this parameter.}

\item{species}{The species on which you did the experiment (not necessary if already present in your datas).
Default is 'Homo Sapiens'.}
}
\value{
A dataframe which contains the hits.
}
\description{
Function to categorize protein according to their Expression/Stability change
based on their I-score and their combined p-value on their two biggest fold changes.
}
