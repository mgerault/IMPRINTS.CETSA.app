}
\arguments{
\item{hits}{The hitlist; a data.frame containing the genes id and preferably a treatment column but not necessary.}

\item{gene_column}{The name of the coulumn that contains the genes. Default is 'Genes'.}

\item{treatment_column}{The name of the column that contains the treatments. Default is NULL.}

\item{species}{Specify the species. Currently, only 'human' and 'mouse' are available.}

\item{n_pathway}{Number of pathway to show on plot. Default is 5.
For more info you, see \code{\link{compareCluster}}.}

\item{pval_cutoff}{The p-value cutoff for the enrichment analysis.}

\item{database}{Specify the database. Currently, WikiPathway, KEGG and GO ar available.}
}
\value{
A list that contains the results and the plot.
}
\description{
Function to run enrichment analysis on your hits and return
a plot that compare the pathways found between your treatments.
