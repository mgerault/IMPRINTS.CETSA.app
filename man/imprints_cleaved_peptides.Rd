\arguments{
\item{data}{The normalized peptides data set, i.e. the outpout from \code{imprints_normalize_peptides}.}

\item{data_diff}{The log2 fold-changes peptides data set, i.e. the outpout from \code{imprints_sequence_peptides}.
If NULL, it will be computed.}

\item{control}{The control treatment from your dataset.}

\item{min_ValidValue}{The minimum proportion of non-missing values per peptides.
Default is 0.4; so if 6 temperatures need at least 3 non missing values.}

\item{min_peptide}{The minimum number of peptides per protein to be considered a RESP candidate.
Default is 4.}

\item{FDR}{The FDR used to obtained the final p-value cutoff. Default is 0.01}

\item{comb_pv_method}{The method used to combine p-values. Either george, fisher or edgington.
Default is george. See Details.}

\item{RESP_score}{The RESP score cutoff. Default is 0.5}

\item{fixed_score_cutoff}{Logical to tell if you want to use a fixed cutoff for the RESP score.
Default is FALSE. See Details.}

\item{categorize}{Logical to categorize or not the obtained hits using the function \code{\link{imprints_categorize_peptides}}.
Default is TRUE.}

\item{curvature}{The curvature used for the curve on the volcano plot}

\item{folder_name}{The name of the folder in which you want to save the results.}
}
\value{
The potential cleaved sites from the proteins considered as cleaved.
  A folder will also be saved where you'll find a volcano plots and results data.

\description{
Function to find proteins that are potentially cleaved and their cleaved sites.
For more information, see Details section.
}
\details{
The idea of this function is to compute the sum from all fold change for each peptide and then compute the cumulative sum of
these summed fold change of every peptides for each protein.
If the protein is not cleaved, this cumulative sum should be constantly increasing/decreasing, i.e linear.
If the protein is cleaved, then this cumulative sum will either be convex or concave.
If convex, the last peptides are more abundant; if concave the first peptides are more abundant.
In the end a volcano plot will be plotted where the p-value corresponds to the combined p-value from
the six temperatures comparison between peptides located towards the N-terminal and the ones located
towards the C-terminal position.
You can then use the function \code{imprints_sequence_peptides} to plot the peptides before and after
the potential cleavage site.

George's method correspond to the sum of the logit of the p-values, Fisher's to the sum of the
log of the p-values and Edgington's is the sum of the p-values.
Edgington's method is the most stringent and is particularly sensitive with higher p-values
whereas Fisher's mmethod is the less stringent as it is mostly sensitive to low p-values.
George's method is a compromise between the two methods.

About the fixed_score_cutoff,if TRUE, the value RESP_score will directly be used as the cutoff and
for all treatments. If FALSE, the RESP score cutoff will be calculated as the value selected for
RESP_score plus the median of the scores of the proteins which have a p-value lower than the median
of all p-values for a given treatment.
