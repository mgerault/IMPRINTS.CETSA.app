\item{boundedness}{Number of SD/SEM, the mean needs to be within.}

\item{qualitycutoff}{The threshold value for the SD/SEM to separate well-measured and illmeasured measurements.}

\item{meandev}{The deviation of individual mean from the group mean in CN categorization.}

\item{expstr}{List of strings with treatments/drugs and control group}

\item{use_prompt}{Logical to tell if you want to use the prompt function (added for the shiny app)}
